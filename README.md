# sleep-tracker

Built an app that stores and tracks sleep data submitted by the user. This will be used by myself to track my sleep! Not much more to explain here.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, Express

This was another CRUD app that I created on my own, but the first utilizing MVC structure to organize . I used an EJS file to handle the dynamic content coming from the database and used a for each loop to handle that data. The event listener on the client-side js file handled the click events for deleting and submitting of a new 'day log entry'. After getting the data provided by the client to successfully be sent to MongoDB. I did end up using a two column layout and implemented some media queries for both the history/form page and edit page. MVC was daunting at first, but after getting a hang of it it makes it so much easier to organize and get around the app.

## Optimizations

I wanted to add a graph that shows the data going back a week and a month and maybe an average of times of sleep. Maybe some more styling.

## Lessons Learned:

Again, MVC was eye opening as far as organization and making sure that a small change on a part of the app doesn't break the whole thing. I'm sure this will make working on a team much easier.
